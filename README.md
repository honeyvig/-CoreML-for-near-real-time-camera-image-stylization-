# -CoreML-for-near-real-time-camera-image-stylization
To perform near real-time camera image stylization using CoreML, we need to use a pre-trained neural network model that performs style transfer. The basic idea is to take an image from the camera, process it with a pre-trained style transfer model, and then display the stylized result in real-time.

We'll be using the following components in this implementation:

    CoreML for the machine learning model.
    Vision framework to handle image processing.
    AVFoundation to capture camera input in real-time.

For stylization, we can use a pre-trained neural style transfer model. There are a number of publicly available models for style transfer, including models trained on neural networks like VGG. You can either convert an existing model to CoreML or use a model that is already CoreML compatible.

Here's an outline of the code to achieve real-time image stylization using CoreML:
Prerequisites:

    Xcode 12 or later (for using CoreML and Vision framework)
    CoreML model for style transfer (you can use models like FastNeuralStyle, or other pre-trained models converted to CoreML)

Steps:

    Import necessary frameworks:
        AVFoundation (for capturing the live camera feed)
        CoreML (for using the pre-trained neural network model)
        Vision (for image processing)

    Set up the camera capture:
        Capture the camera image in real-time.
        Process the image with the CoreML style transfer model.

    Apply style transfer:
        Use CoreML to apply the style transfer to the captured camera image.

    Display the stylized image:
        Show the stylized image in real-time.

Code Example:
1. Setup Camera Capture

We'll use AVCaptureSession to capture the camera feed and pass the image to the CoreML model for stylization.

import UIKit
import AVFoundation
import CoreML
import Vision

class CameraViewController: UIViewController {
    
    @IBOutlet weak var previewView: UIView!
    var session: AVCaptureSession!
    var previewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer!
    var styleModel: VNCoreMLModel?
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Load CoreML Style Transfer model
        loadStyleTransferModel()
        
        // Setup camera session
        setupCameraSession()
    }
    
    // Load the pre-trained CoreML model
    func loadStyleTransferModel() {
        guard let modelURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "FastNeuralStyle", withExtension: "mlmodelc") else {
            print("Model not found!")
            return
        }
        
        do {
            let model = try MLModel(contentsOf: modelURL)
            styleModel = try VNCoreMLModel(for: model)
        } catch {
            print("Error loading CoreML model: \(error)")
        }
    }
    
    // Setup the camera session to capture frames
    func setupCameraSession() {
        session = AVCaptureSession()
        
        guard let videoCaptureDevice = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video) else { return }
        let videoDeviceInput: AVCaptureDeviceInput
        
        do {
            videoDeviceInput = try AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: videoCaptureDevice)
        } catch {
            print("Error setting up camera input: \(error)")
            return
        }
        
        if (session.canAddInput(videoDeviceInput)) {
            session.addInput(videoDeviceInput)
        } else {
            return
        }
        
        let videoDataOutput = AVCaptureVideoDataOutput()
        videoDataOutput.setSampleBufferDelegate(self, queue: DispatchQueue(label: "videoQueue"))
        
        if (session.canAddOutput(videoDataOutput)) {
            session.addOutput(videoDataOutput)
        }
        
        previewLayer = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(session: session)
        previewLayer.frame = previewView.bounds
        previewLayer.videoGravity = .resizeAspectFill
        previewView.layer.addSublayer(previewLayer)
        
        session.startRunning()
    }
}

extension CameraViewController: AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate {
    
    // Delegate method to process captured video frames
    func captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
        // Get the pixel buffer from the sample buffer
        guard let pixelBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(sampleBuffer) else {
            return
        }
        
        // Perform style transfer on the captured image
        applyStyleTransfer(pixelBuffer)
    }
    
    // Apply the style transfer using CoreML
    func applyStyleTransfer(_ pixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer) {
        // Perform the style transfer using CoreML
        guard let styleModel = styleModel else { return }
        
        let request = VNCoreMLRequest(model: styleModel) { (request, error) in
            if let results = request.results as? [VNPixelBufferObservation], let observation = results.first {
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    // Display the stylized image
                    self.updatePreview(with: observation.pixelBuffer)
                }
            }
        }
        
        let handler = VNImageRequestHandler(ciImage: CIImage(cvPixelBuffer: pixelBuffer), options: [:])
        try? handler.perform([request])
    }
    
    // Update the preview with the stylized image
    func updatePreview(with pixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer) {
        // Convert the pixel buffer to UIImage
        let ciImage = CIImage(cvPixelBuffer: pixelBuffer)
        let context = CIContext()
        if let cgImage = context.createCGImage(ciImage, from: ciImage.extent) {
            let image = UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)
            
            // Display the stylized image on the screen
            self.previewView.layer.contents = image.cgImage
        }
    }
}

Key Points:

    CoreML Model: We load a pre-trained CoreML model for style transfer. You can convert a model like FastNeuralStyle from PyTorch or TensorFlow into CoreML using coremltools.
    AVCaptureSession: This is used to capture the camera feed. The video frames are passed to the captureOutput method, which calls the applyStyleTransfer function for real-time processing.
    Vision Framework: We use VNCoreMLRequest to run the CoreML model on each captured frame.
    Display the Stylized Image: After the model processes the frame, we update the UI with the stylized image.

2. Convert PyTorch or TensorFlow Style Transfer Model to CoreML:

If you're using a style transfer model that isn't CoreML compatible, you can convert it using the coremltools library.
Example of Converting a TensorFlow Model:

import coremltools as ct
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('style_transfer_model.h5')

# Convert the TensorFlow model to CoreML
coreml_model = ct.convert(model)

# Save the CoreML model
coreml_model.save('FastNeuralStyle.mlmodel')

3. Model Loading:

After converting the model, the .mlmodel file should be added to your Xcode project. The CoreML model can then be loaded and used for inference.
Final Notes:

    Performance: Applying style transfer in real-time can be computationally expensive, especially for high-resolution video. You may need to downscale the input images to achieve a smoother real-time performance.
    Pretrained Models: Using models that are already optimized for style transfer will significantly improve performance.
    Privacy Considerations: If you're using live camera feed and processing images, make sure to inform users about privacy and get appropriate permissions.

This is a simple demonstration of how to perform near real-time image stylization using CoreML and AVFoundation in an iOS app. You can enhance this by adding additional features like multiple style transfer models, user-configurable styles, or optimizing performance using Metal for GPU acceleration.
